# LIFESCOPE Browser Extension

> LIFESCOPE is the internet of you.

> This is the browser history scraper powered by oEmbed tools and the LIFESCOPE API.

## Developer Setup

1. Clone this repo
2. Install the repo's directory as an extension

Any changes you make to your cloned repo will be seen immediately in the installed extension. Though sometimes changing translation files (in _locales/) requires a manual extension refresh in Chrome's extension settings.

For detailed explanation on how things work, checkout the [LIFESCOPE docs](https://lifescope.io/learn).
