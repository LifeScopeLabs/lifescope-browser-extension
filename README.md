BitScoop Browser Plugin for Chrome
=================

Chrome is an excellent browser, but browsing your history kinda stinks.

Getting rolling
----------------

1. Clone this repo
2. Install the repo's directory as an extension

Any changes you make to your cloned repo will be seen immediately in the installed extension. Though sometimes changing translation files (in _locales/) requires a manual extension refresh in Chrome's extension settings.
